- Finds and reserves your target class based on class name, instructor, and time
- Handles waitlist scenarios
- Sends notifications via email and/or SMS about reservation status
- Can be scheduled to run at specific times (e.g., when registration opens)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- Selenium WebDriver
- Gmail account (or other email provider) for sending notifications

   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

# Bot Configuration
HEADLESS=true
RUN_ON_SCHEDULE=true
```

## Email Setup

1. Use a Gmail account
2. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account
3. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings â†’ Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", scroll to "App passwords"
   - Generate a new app password
   - Use this password for EMAIL_PASSWORD in your `.env` file

## SMS Notification Setup

The bot uses email-to-SMS gateways provided by mobile carriers to send text messages. No additional accounts or services are required beyond your existing email setup.

### Supported SMS Carriers

The following carriers are supported for SMS notifications:

- `att` - AT&T
- `tmobile` - T-Mobile
- `verizon` - Verizon
- `sprint` - Sprint
- `boost` - Boost Mobile
- `cricket` - Cricket Wireless
- `metro` - Metro by T-Mobile
- `uscellular` - US Cellular
- `virgin` - Virgin Mobile
- `xfinity` - Xfinity Mobile
- `googlefi` - Google Fi

To use SMS notifications:
1. Set `NOTIFICATION_METHOD` to either `sms` or `both` in your `.env` file
2. Set `SMS_NUMBER` to your phone number (digits only, no formatting)
3. Set `SMS_CARRIER` to your carrier from the supported list

## Scheduling
The bot runs automatically via GitHub Actions:
- Schedule: 10:00 UTC Sunday through Thursday (`0 10 * * 0-4`)
- Can also be triggered manually through GitHub Actions interface

### Running at a Specific UTC Time

The bot includes functionality to wait until a specific UTC time before running. This is useful for ensuring the bot runs exactly when class registration opens.

The default time is set to 16:00:00 UTC. You can modify this in the `lifetime_bot.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wait_until_utc("16:00:00")  # Change this to your desired UTC time
```

## Local Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Chrome browser
- Required packages: `selenium`, `python-dotenv`, `webdriver-manager`

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with the same variables as GitHub Secrets
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run locally:
   ```bash
   python lifetime_bot.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failures**: Ensure your Life Time Fitness credentials are correct in the `.env` file.

2. **Class Not Found**: Verify the class name, instructor, and time match exactly what's shown on the Life Time website.

3. **Email Notification Failures**: 
   - For Gmail, you need to use an App Password instead of your regular password
   - Enable "Less secure app access" or use 2FA with app passwords

4. **SMS Notification Failures**:
   - Verify your phone number is entered correctly without any formatting
   - Ensure you've selected the correct carrier

- Check GitHub Actions logs for execution details
- Email/SMS notifications will be sent for both successful and failed reservations
- For local testing, set `HEADLESS=false` to watch the automation in action

## Security Note
- Never commit your `.env` file
- Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
- Regularly rotate your email app password
